# Slope Calculator using Horner's Rule
Computes the slope of a given function at a point.

## Features
* Uses Dijkstra's Shunting Yard Algorithm to parse user expressions
* Supports trigonometric and logorithmic functions
* Has a GUI similar to the Apple calculator
* Error traps user input
* Uses Horner's Rule to evaluate polynomial expressions
* Uses Object-Oriented-Programming design techniques
